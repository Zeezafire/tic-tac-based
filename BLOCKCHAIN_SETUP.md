# Blockchain Integration Setup Guide

Your Tic-Tac-Toe game now requires **$0.10 USD in ETH** to play each round on Base Sepolia testnet!

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Test ETH
Visit the Base Sepolia faucet to get free testnet ETH:
- **Alchemy Faucet**: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
- **Coinbase Faucet**: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet

### 2. Add Base Sepolia to MetaMask
Click "Add Network" in MetaMask and use these details:
- **Network Name**: Base Sepolia
- **RPC URL**: https://sepolia.base.org
- **Chain ID**: 84532
- **Currency Symbol**: ETH
- **Block Explorer**: https://sepolia.basescan.org

### 3. Deploy the Smart Contract

#### Using Remix (Easiest Method)
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org
2. Create a new file called `TicTacToeGame.sol`
3. Copy the contract code from `contracts/TicTacToeGame.sol`
4. Click "Compile" (Solidity 0.8.20+)
5. Connect MetaMask to Base Sepolia
6. Click "Deploy"
7. **Copy the deployed contract address**

#### After Deployment
Update the contract address in `client/src/lib/web3.ts`:
```typescript
export const GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE' as const
```

### 4. Get a WalletConnect Project ID (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID
5. Update it in `client/src/lib/web3.ts`:
```typescript
projectId: 'YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID',
```

## How It Works

### Dynamic Pricing
- The game charges **$0.10 USD** worth of ETH per game
- The frontend fetches real-time ETH prices from CoinGecko API
- At $2,000/ETH, you'll pay ~0.00005 ETH per game
- At $4,000/ETH, you'll pay ~0.000025 ETH per game

### Smart Contract
- **Owner-only controls**: Only you (the deployer) can:
  - Adjust the minimum payment threshold
  - Withdraw collected funds
- **Minimum payment**: 0.00001 ETH (prevents spam)
- **Payment validation**: Contract ensures sufficient payment before starting a game

### Game Flow
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" button
2. **Start Game**: Click "Pay & Start Game ($0.10)"
3. **Confirm Transaction**: Approve in MetaMask
4. **Wait for Confirmation**: Transaction processes on blockchain
5. **Play**: Game board activates after confirmation!
6. **New Round**: Each new game requires another $0.10 payment

## Contract Functions (Owner Only)

### Update Minimum Payment
If ETH price changes dramatically, update the minimum:
```solidity
// In Remix or Etherscan
updateMinPayment(newAmount) // Amount in wei
```

### Withdraw Collected Funds
Withdraw ETH from the contract:
```solidity
// In Remix or Etherscan
withdraw() // Sends all ETH to owner address
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Contract Not Deployed" Error
- Make sure you deployed the contract on Base Sepolia
- Update the contract address in `client/src/lib/web3.ts`

### "Insufficient Payment" Error
- The contract's minPayment might be too high
- As owner, call `updateMinPayment(10000000000000)` to set it to 0.00001 ETH

### Transaction Fails
- Ensure you have enough Base Sepolia ETH (get from faucet)
- Check that you're connected to Base Sepolia network in MetaMask
- Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask

### Price Fetch Issues
- The app uses CoinGecko's free API to fetch ETH prices
- If unavailable, it falls back to $2,000/ETH estimate
- Price updates on page load

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Implemented**:
- Owner-only access control for admin functions
- Minimum payment threshold prevents dust transactions
- Dynamic USD pricing via off-chain oracle (CoinGecko)

‚ö†Ô∏è **For Production** (optional improvements):
- Add ownership transfer function
- Implement on-chain price oracle (Chainlink)
- Add emergency pause functionality
- Multi-sig wallet for fund management

## Network Details
