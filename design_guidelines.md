# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach**: Design System with Gaming UI Principles  
**Justification**: This utility-focused game prioritizes clear interaction, immediate feedback, and intuitive gameplay. Drawing inspiration from modern casual gaming interfaces (Apple Arcade aesthetics, minimal puzzle games) combined with Material Design principles for consistent component behavior.

**Core Design Principles**:
- Clarity over decoration - game state must be immediately obvious
- Generous tap targets for comfortable interaction
- Clear visual hierarchy: game board > game status > controls
- Responsive layout that works across all devices

---

## Layout System

**Container Structure**:
- Full viewport centering: flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen
- Game container: max-w-md mx-auto for optimal viewing
- Consistent spacing units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 (Tailwind scale)

**Game Board**:
- 3x3 grid layout using CSS Grid (grid-cols-3 gap-3)
- Square cells using aspect-ratio-1/1
- Board container padding: p-6 to p-8
- Cells: Generous touch targets (minimum 80px × 80px on mobile, 120px × 120px on desktop)

**Vertical Spacing**:
- space-y-8 between major sections (header, board, controls)
- space-y-4 for grouped elements (score displays, button groups)

---

## Typography

**Font Selection**: 
- Primary: 'Inter' or 'SF Pro Display' via Google Fonts CDN
- Game symbols (X/O): Consider 'Space Grotesk' or stick with primary font at larger weights

**Type Scale**:
- Page title: text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold
- Game status message: text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold
- Score labels: text-sm font-medium uppercase tracking-wide
- Score values: text-2xl font-bold
- X/O symbols: text-5xl md:text-6xl font-bold
- Buttons: text-base font-semibold

---

## Component Library

### 1. Game Header
- Title centered with decorative spacing below
- Score display: Two-column flex layout (Player X | Player O)
- Each score: Icon/letter + number in compact card-like containers (p-3 rounded-lg)

### 2. Game Board
- Container: Rounded corners (rounded-2xl), elevated feel (shadow-xl)
- Grid cells: Individual rounded squares (rounded-xl), hover states with subtle scale transform
- Cell borders: Consistent stroke width (border-2)
- Active cell state: Distinct visual treatment
- Winning combination: Highlight with stronger treatment (increased shadow or scale)

### 3. Game Status Banner
- Centered text display above or below board
- Turn indicator: "Player X's Turn" / "Player O's Turn"  
- Win announcement: Larger, bolder treatment with celebration feel
- Draw state: Neutral messaging

### 4. Control Buttons
- Reset/New Game: Primary button, full width or centered (px-8 py-3)
- Rounded buttons (rounded-lg)
- Clear hover and active states (scale-105 transform)
- Icons from Heroicons (arrow-path for reset)

### 5. Cell Content
- X symbol: Rotated cross or custom styling
- O symbol: Circle outline
- Center-aligned within cells (flex items-center justify-center)
- Smooth entrance animations when placed (scale or fade-in)

## Interaction Patterns

### Game Flow
1. **Initial State**: Empty board, "Player X starts" message
2. **Player Turn**: Hover states on empty cells, cursor pointer
3. **Move Placement**: Click/tap to place symbol with animation
4. **Win Detection**: Highlight winning line, announce winner, disable board
5. **Reset**: Clear board, reset scores optional, return to initial state

### Visual Feedback
- Cell hover: Subtle scale (hover:scale-105) or opacity change
- Cell click: Brief active state (active:scale-95)
- Symbol appearance: Fade-in + scale animation (animate duration-200)
- Winning cells: Pulsing effect or stronger shadow
- Disabled state: Reduced opacity (opacity-50), no pointer events

---

## Responsive Behavior

**Mobile (base)**:
- Single column layout, full width with padding (px-4)
- Cell size: 80-100px squares
- Stack scores vertically if needed
- Touch-optimized spacing (gap-3 minimum)

**Tablet (md:)**:
- Larger cells: 120px squares  
- Horizontal score layout maintained
- Increased spacing (gap-4)

**Desktop (lg:)**:
- Maximum cell size: 140px
- More generous padding around board (p-8)
- Comfortable spacing for mouse interaction

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML: `<button>` for cells and controls
- ARIA labels: "Cell 1", "Cell 2", etc. for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through cells, Enter/Space to place
- Focus indicators: Clear outline on focused cells (ring-4)
- Announcement regions: aria-live for game status updates

---

## Icons

**Library**: Heroicons via CDN  
**Usage**:
- Reset button: arrow-path icon
- Trophy icon for winner announcement (optional)
- Keep icon usage minimal - game symbols are text-based

---

## Polish Details

- Smooth transitions on all interactive elements (transition-all duration-200)
- Subtle shadows for depth (shadow-lg on board, shadow-md on cells)
- Consistent border radius throughout (rounded-xl for main containers, rounded-lg for cells)
- Prevent text selection on game board (select-none)
- Celebrate wins with subtle animation on winning cells
- Disabled pointer events on filled cells (pointer-events-none)
