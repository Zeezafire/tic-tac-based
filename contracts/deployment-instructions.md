2. Install Remix IDE extension or use https://remix.ethereum.org

## Deployment Steps

### Using Remix IDE

2. Create a new file: `TicTacToeGame.sol`
3. Copy the contract code from `contracts/TicTacToeGame.sol`
4. Compile the contract (Solidity 0.8.20+)

   - RPC URL: https://sepolia.base.org
   - Chain ID: 84532
